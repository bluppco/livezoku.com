<CustomerReview
    description1="“At first glance, Zoku appears to be just another hotel with spacious rooms, a creative marketing team, and some great puns on its coffee mugs. But taking a closer look – there is so much more to unpack. I have been living and working here for a little over a month now, and I have been wowed by the sense of belonging and community this place conveys. So much so, that I have extended my stay by another month. It’s truly the best place to land in when moving to a city like Amsterdam, much of which is owed to the people that work here alongside everyone who decides to come back here to work remotely, day after day. It nails down a perfect balance between being an atmosphere that fosters creativity and productivity.”"
